# Javascript Quiz Game

A timed coding quiz that tests your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals and allows you to store your high scores.

## Description

This coding quiz is designed for coding bootcamp students to gauge their progress in JavaScript. It features a start button that, when clicked, starts a timer and displays the first question. The quiz contains multiple-choice questions with buttons for each answer. When an answer is clicked, the next question appears. If the answer clicked was incorrect, time is subtracted from the clock. The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. At the end of the quiz, your score is displayed, and you have the option to save your initials and score for future reference.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges of this project was implementing the timer and score tracking functionality, as it required careful manipulation of variables and logic to ensure accurate and consistent results.

## Things I learned
